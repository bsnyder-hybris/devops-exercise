Hey guys, Here's the application I've been working on all summer. 
It's running pretty good on my machine. Hope you find it useful. Also, remember
that I'm looking for a full-time job next fall, really loved working with you guys. 

This should be enough to get you started.

Install mysql:

$ brew install mysql
$ brew tap homebrew/services
$ brew services start mysql

Reset root password:

$ brew services stop mysql
$ rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
$ mysqld --initialize 
$ brew services start mysql
$ mysql -u root -p

mysql>ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass'
mysql>CREATE USER 'youser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yoimcool';
mysql>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'youser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql>CREATE DATABASE yo;

Run the application
$ mvn spring-boot:run

If you want to run without Maven: 
$ java -jar target/yo-1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    -Dserver.port=80 \
    -Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/yo

Test application:

$ curl -v 'localhost:8080/v1/user/add?name=First&email=someemail@someemailprovider.com'
$ curl -v 'localhost:8080/v1/user/list'
